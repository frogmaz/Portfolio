      <p>
        My name is Milo≈° Obrovac and I'm a self-tought front-end web developer from Novi Sad, Serbia.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drew me to web development was gradual understanding of potential for learning and enriching one's life that this field offers. Growing market for a skill set that combines strict technical knowledge with visual creativity, team work and interaction with costumers, just seemed very suitable for my personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent several years living abroad as a volunteer, exchange student and a menial worker, so I'm quite used to adapting to new people and working enviorment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main goal as a developer is to understand and implement client's needs.
